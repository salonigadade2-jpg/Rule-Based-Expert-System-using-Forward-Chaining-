⭐ Project Overview

This rule-based expert system:

Builds a small rule engine (if–then rules)

Accepts user facts (symptoms)

Infers conclusions using forward chaining

Supports multi-step inference

Logs reasoning steps so users can understand the reasoning path



---

🔧 Features

✔ Forward chaining inference
✔ Multiple rules and conditions
✔ Dynamic user input
✔ Clear reasoning trace
✔ Beginner-friendly AI project


---

📌 Technologies Used

Python 3

Rule-based AI concepts

Text-based interface

🧩 How Forward Chaining Works

1. User enters symptoms (facts).


2. The engine checks which rules match the facts.


3. When a rule matches, the THEN conclusion is inferred.


4. New conclusions may trigger more rules.


5. Final diagnosis is displayed



**EXAMPLE :-**
=== Rule-Based Expert System ===

Enter your symptoms (comma separated): fever, cough

Processing your symptoms...

✔ Matched Rule: ['fever', 'cough']
👉 Diagnosis: Flu
